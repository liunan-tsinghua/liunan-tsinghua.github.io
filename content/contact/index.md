      title: Welcome to the LIU lab!
      text: |-

        Our lab is dedicated to uncovering macromolecular architectures and elucidating their molecular mechanisms by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI), cell biology, and advanced cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). As an interdisciplinary research team, we focus on cellular structural biology, particularly membrane remodeling processes and higher-order protein assemblies.

        We embrace any technology that advances our understanding of cellular structures and are keen on developing novel cryo-EM methodologies when existing tools fall short.

        Explore our research and reach out to us at SBS, HKU!
