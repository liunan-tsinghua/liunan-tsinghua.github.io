        Our laboratory specializes in cryo-EM-based structural biology, with a primary focus on developing cryo-EM methodologies and applying them to study macromolecular assemblies. We leverage AI-powered tools, material sciences, and biochemistry to advance our research. We are an open-minded and collaborative group, and we warmly welcome individuals from any research background to reach out for discussions or to explore opportunities to join our team and enjoy the vibrant lab life. 
        
        **1**.	We are interested in **cryo-EM methodology development**. We have invented various cryo-EM specimen preparation methods through the integration of nanomaterials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, with bioactive functionalization strategies. Key achievements include:

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(1)** Developing graphene-based supporting films of cryo-EM specimen, including the reduced graphene oxide membrane (Biophysics Reports, 2021), monolayer single-crystal graphene (JACS, 2019), Janus graphene (ACS Nano, 2021), and ultraflat graphene (Nat Methods, 2023).

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(2)** Functionalizing these films with bioactive ligands to adjust their interactions with biomolecular particles (Nat Commun, 2022; JACS, 2019; JACS, 2023; Nat Commun, 2024). These methods improve the efficiency of cryo-EM structural determination (JMB, 2023; COSB, 2024). 

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**(3)** Developing a graphene sandwich-based sample preparation workflow (PNAS, 2024), which uses two layers of graphene to encapsulate biological samples for cryo-EM characterization.

        **2.**	We are interested in exploring the **molecular mechanisms underlying membrane curvature maintenance**  using cryo-EM techniques. We recently uncovered how the integral membrane protein tetraspanin-7 induces and stabilizes tubular membrane structures through the formation of a spiral high-order arrangement (bioRxiv, 2024).
